 A new study led by researchers at Edge Hill University is to investigate how artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to improve early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. 

Researchers have been awarded a £100,000 start-up grant from Cancer Research UK, Pancreatic Cancer UK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), to explore whether AI holds the potential to detect early signs of the disease before symptoms start to appear, at which point the cancer is usually too advanced for treatment. 

By using data from patients who have been diagnosed with the disease, researchers will use AI to identify potential biomarkers and risk groups who are more likely to develop pancreatic cancer in the future. 

According to Cancer Research UK, there are around 10,300 new pancreatic cancer cases in the UK every year, with around eight in 10 cases being diagnosed at a late stage in England and Scotland. 

Polling for Pancreatic Cancer UK revealed that just one in 10 GPs say they have the tools they need to diagnose pancreatic cancer early enough for treatment to be possible. 

Dr Ardhendu Behera is a Reader in Computer Vision & AI at Edge Hill and the lead researcher on the project.

 Dr Behera said: “Pancreatic cancer progresses very rapidly and because no method of early detection has been discovered, it is one of the most dangerous types of cancer. Symptoms are usually very vague and do not appear until the cancer is in its later stages, at which point it is sadly too late to treat effectively in most cases. 

“This is a data-driven approach that aims to find out whether it is possible to use AI to signal that there are links between risk groups and those who have already been diagnosed. Using routinely collected data such as CT/MRI, health conditions, pathology, and blood tests, the AI can identify the possible predictors of pancreatic cancer and will screen out people at high-risk. The potential of AI is incredible, and in this instance could help to save and extend the lives of patients.”

 Led by Edge Hill, the year-long study will involve co-coordinator institution Queen Mary University of London, as well as researchers from University College London, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Hertfordshire.

Dr Chris MacDonald, Head of Research at the charity Pancreatic Cancer UK, said: “Survival for pancreatic cancer has barely changed for 50 years, and the difficulty doctors face in diagnosing this devastating disease is a key reason why it remains the deadliest common cancer in the UK.  

“Innovative projects like this one, which bring together experts who would never normally collaborate, are vital if we’re to make the progress needed to see more people diagnosed earlier and in time for treatment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) could play a critical role in predicting which of the thousands of people a year who visit their GP with vague symptoms – like backpain, weight loss and indigestion – are at risk of having pancreatic cancer. Helping to determine whether people need closely monitoring, or even urgently referring for scans, could save lives.  

“Applying AI to pancreatic cancer detection has never been done before, making this a truly unique project and one we are hugely proud to be funding. Currently, more than 50% of people with pancreatic cancer die within three months of diagnosis. For that tragic statistic to change we need more research like this that tests innovative new ideas, which we hope will one day become lifesaving interventions adopted by the NHS.” 

Michelle Mitchell, Chief Executive of Cancer Research UK, said: “We’re proud to support pioneering work bridging the gap between biology and computer sciences, in the continued search for ways to detect the earliest stages of pancreatic cancer.  

“In those areas of cancer research where progress has been particularly difficult, bringing together researchers across different disciplines is the way forward. I’m hopeful that this innovative project might bring us closer to being able to diagnose cancer at an early stage, and with it the hope of better outcomes for people with pancreatic cancer.”
