A mature student is graduating with a First Class Honours degree from Edge Hill University and has secured a dream job with BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, working with clients to design and improve the user experience of their online systems.

Wade Phillips, from Cornwall, first chose his BSc (Hons) Web Design & Development degree after identifying a career in web design as a flexible job with a lot of opportunities.

Wade said: “I previously worked as a paramedic but always loved travelling, I’d often use all my annual leave at once and take two or three months off to see the world. What I really wanted was a job that would allow me to work while I travelled. Web design jumped out at me as a job I could do anywhere and for any number of businesses or organisations.”
    </p>

    <p>
Wade chose Edge Hill for its specific web design degree and because of the University’s high employment rate within the profession. He’d never studied coding before but with support from his lecturers he quickly picked it up.

“Coding was difficult at first, but I managed to pick it up and now I’m graduating with a first and all the tools needed to succeed in the web design industry.” Wade added. “I amazed myself by getting the highest mark on the course two years in a row.
        
“As a mature student I definitely got more out of university second time around. I feel like I’ve learned and got so much out of the course. I would say the top three skills I gained from the degree would be problem solving, teamwork and communication skills but all more so in a technology-based setting, using a range of tools that I would not have otherwise gained experience with.”
        
“I can’t thank my lecturers enough for all the support and encouragement I’ve had over the last three years, especially through the pandemic where they’ve made learning from home really simple. I also got three scholarships to support me along the way which made life a little easier for me and allowed me to focus on my studies.”

     <p>
Wade will soon start his job as a User Experience Consultant for BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, working with clients to provide the best user experience possible for their digital solutions.

“My plans for the future are to continue bridging the gap between users and digital products and services. Ultimately, I want to make a difference to people’s lives by utilising the latest research to improve on the technologies they use. Eventually, I would love to start my own consultancy firm and share my passion for user experience with a wider range of clients all over the globe.”
