</section>

<section class="article-content">
    <p>Edge Hill University is celebrating a double win at this year’s Educate North Awards.

        The University has been honoured with two accolades in recognition of its work in mental health and wellbeing, and business collaboration.
        Vice-Chancellor Dr John Cater said:
    </p>
    
    <p class="quote"> “I am so proud the University has been recognised with two coveted Educate North awards.

        “They highlight our commitment to giving back to the community we serve – whether through an aim to improve the mental health of our children and young people, or by supporting businesses through the toughest of times.”
    </p>
    <p>The double success follows Edge Hill’s reign as Educate North University of the Year awarded for the 2020/21 academic year, and the Modern University of the Year 2021/22 title awarded by the Times and Sunday Times.

     <p>Edge Hill’s Tackling the Blues mental health programme for children and young people, in partnership with Everton in the Community and Tate Liverpool, won the ‘mental health and wellbeing’ awards, rewarding its success and impact. Ongoing research and evaluation shows all pupils involved in the programme are displaying increased confidence and less anxiety, with improved literacy and emotional intelligence skills.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
        Dr Helen O’Keeffe from the Faculty of Education and Andy Smith, Professor of Sport and Physical Activity, who lead the project for Edge Hill, said: “This win recognises our commitment to supporting the mental health of our children and young people, and confirms the importance of our groundbreaking research which has a real impact on the lives of young people, their schools and communities.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The University’s Small and Medium Enterprise Productivity & Innovation Centre (SME PIC), which is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, won the ‘business collaboration and partnerships award – university sector’ for its work on helping local businesses scale-up.

        Professor Simon Bolton, Director of SME PIC, said: “This win is not only testament to the hard work of the SME PIC team but also recognition of the impact the programme has had on helping ambitious SMEs from across the region to grow through job creation, and product and service innovation.”
