 Gamers are set to converge on Edge Hill University when it plays host to the world’s largest game creation event.

The University’s new cutting edge Technology Hub is a host venue for 2017’s Global Game Jam (GGJ) taking place this weekend (20-22 Jan).

Attracting over 30,000 people in 93 countries, GGJ brings people together to design, develop and create a video game in 48 hours.

Around 50 students from across the University will meet at the Tech Hub on Friday 20th to hear their top secret game theme.

Simultaneously broadcast to venues around the world, the group will then have two days to take the theme and design, develop and create a finished video game, working online alongside professional developers from the global gaming community.

 Dr Peter Matthew, Computing (Games Programming) Programme Leader, said: “We’re really excited to be one of only two venues in the North West hosting this prestigious event. Typically game development is a long, complicated, process so bringing different people together to share their knowledge and ideas to create a finished game at the end, is a fantastic learning opportunity for our students.

“They’ll be able to work alongside professional game developers and make use of the Tech Hub’s new Games Lab offering them the chance to use the best game creation facilities available.”

 Peter added: “For our Computer Science (Games Programming) students, opportunities like this are particularly important as the games industry is typically led by entrepreneurs and small scale teams rather than large companies.

“They need real experience to stand out and improve their employability so this gives them a completed game for their portfolio. It will also hopefully give them the confidence to use the Tech Hub for their own future game creations.”

Previous game themes have included ‘extinction’ and ‘ritual’. The finished games will be available online at www.globalgamejam.org
